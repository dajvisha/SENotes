# The Interview Process

At most of the top tech companies, algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process. The interviewer is looking to evaluate your ability to solve algorithmic problems you havenÂ´t seen before.

Interviewers evaluate:
* **Analytical skills**: 
    * Did you need much help solving the problem?
    * How optimal was your solution?
    * How long did it take you to arrive at a solution?
    * If you had to design/architect a solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?
* **Coding skills**:
    * Were you able to translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
    * Was it clean and well-organized?
    * Did you think about potential errors?
    * Did you use good style?
* **Technical Knowledge / Computer Scince fundamentals**:
    * Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?
* **Experience**:
    * Have you made good technical decisions in the past?
    * Have you built interesting, challenging projects?
    * Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
* **Culture fit / Commnunication skills**:
    * Do your personality and values fit with the company and team?
    * Do you communicate well with the your interviwer?


**Problem-solving skills are valuable**
If you're able to work through several hard problems (with some help), you're probably pretty good at developing optimal algorithms. You are smart. Smart people tend to do good things, and that's valuable at a company.

Interviewers assess you relative to other candidates on the same question by the same interviewer. It's a relative comparison. Your interviewer develops a feel for your performance by comparing you to other people.
